% function [sigmahat, Ht, parameters, ll]=DCCcov(x,demean)
%
% Estimation of scalar DCC(1,1) multivarate volatility model with GARCH(1,1)
% conditional variances
%
% INPUTS:
%   x            - A T by K matrix of zero mean residuals
%   demean       - set to 1 if the data need to be demeaned first, 
%                  and 0 otherwise (optional, default is 1)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   sigmahat     - K*K conditional covariance matrix matrix on last day of
%                  sample [it is equal to Ht(:,:,end)]
%   Ht           - A [K K T] dimension matrix of conditional covariances
%   PARAMETERS   - Estimated parameters.
%                    3-stage: [VOL(1) ... VOL(K) corr_vech(R)' vech(N)' alpha gamma beta]
%                    where VOL(j) is a 3-dimensional vector containing the parameters from
%                    volatility model j.
%   LL           - The log likelihood at the optimum
%
% COMMENTS:
%   The dynamics of the correlations in a 3-stage DCC model are:
%     Q(t) = R*(1-a-b) + a*e(t-1)'*e(t-1) + b*Q(t-1)
%
% same as dccstream11.m but with only straight DCC-NL model
